# KubernetesConcepts
I'm going back to the basics and relearning Kubernetes from scratch ðŸš€

As part of my learning journey, I plan to post one Kubernetes concept a day. I hope this will help me solidify my understanding of the platform and also serve as a useful resource for others who may be in the same boat as me.

To get started, I'll be using the resources available on this YouTube playlist: https://lnkd.in/dVjz3cqh

I'm also taking this free Kubernetes Learning Course on TechiesCamp: https://lnkd.in/dpu3E8tM
 It covers all the basics of Kubernetes and provides hands-on exercises to reinforce the concepts.

For more in-depth learning, I'm also following the Kubernetes Documentation: https://lnkd.in/dUdgghJK


Follow along if you're interested in learning Kubernetes, or if you're a seasoned pro, feel free to offer any insights or corrections along the way.

Let's dive into the world of Kubernetes and see where this journey takes us!
